# Checking for Potential XSS in a Node.js Application

To detect potential Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities in a Node.js application, we can employ pattern matching. Below is the approacht that searches for common patterns which might indicate potential XSS vulnerabilities:

### Explanation of Patterns:

- `innerHTML`: Using `.innerHTML` can introduce XSS if user input is directly assigned to it.
- `document.write`: Can be used to directly write content to the DOM, potentially leading to XSS.
- `outerHTML`: Similar to `innerHTML`, replacing content including tags can lead to vulnerabilities.
- `eval()`: Evaluates JavaScript code represented as a string, which can be risky with user input.
- `setAttribute()`: Depending on its usage, especially with event handlers or executable attributes, it can introduce vulnerabilities.

To utilize this script, run it from the root directory of your Node.js application. This should be used as a preliminary measure and not a substitute for thorough security assessments.
