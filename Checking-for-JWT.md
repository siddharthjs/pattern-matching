# Checking for JWT in a Node.js Application

To verify the presence of JWT code in a Node.js application using pattern matching, we can employ regular expressions. Following this approach:

1. Read all files in your Node.js application.
2. Use regular expressions to identify common patterns linked to JWT, such as `jsonwebtoken` or `Bearer`.
