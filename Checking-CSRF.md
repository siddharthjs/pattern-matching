# Checking for Potential CSRF Protections in a Node.js Application

### Explanation of Patterns:

- `require('csurf')`: Searches for the presence of the `csurf` middleware, a common CSRF protection in Express.js applications.
- `csrfToken()`: In some implementations, this method might be used to obtain the CSRF token.
- `_csrf`: A common naming convention for CSRF input fields or headers.
